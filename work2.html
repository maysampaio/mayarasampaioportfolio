                            <h2>Lettering - Filha de Santo</h2>
                            <p class="box-text">
                                
                                <br>This lettering is deeply connected to my Afro-Brazilian religiosity. The history of African religions in Brazil reveals centuries of prejudice and struggle to preserve the practice of non-Christian faiths while redefining their meaning for the present and future.<br>

                                <br>To begin with, it’s important to acknowledge that Brazil endured 300 years of Black slavery and was the last country in the Americas to abolish it. Throughout Brazilian history, the Black community and all things associated with it have been segregated and marginalized. From the 18th century to today, Brazil continues to reflect racial prejudice in its political, economic, and social systems.</br>
                                
                                <br>Recognizing myself as part of an Afro-Brazilian religion is not only a spiritual journey but also a political and social stance in support of the Black community and against religious intolerance. Even today, temples of these religions are often targeted by violence and arson. Followers who walk in public wearing traditional attire face the risk of verbal and physical aggression.</br>
                                
                                <br>With this context in mind, let’s talk about the lettering. It reads Daughter of Orisha. The term Son of Saint has historically been used to describe us. This expression, created by outsiders, emerged in a context where associating our Orishas with Catholic saints provided a minimal level of societal acceptance, making conversations about our religion somewhat more tolerable to the dominant Christian perspective.</br>
                                
                                <br>However, we do not worship Catholic saints. They are neither our deities nor part of our worldview. They are not figures with whom we share intimacy or connection. So, why continue using this imposed nomenclature? We are Sons of Orixás! They are integral to our beliefs, our strength, and our spiritual family.</br>
                                
                                <br>Through this lettering, I aim to challenge the labels imposed by oppression and reclaim our true identity, asserting who we are rather than what others have told us to be.</br></p>
