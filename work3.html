                                <br>An NGO was created to connect the LGBTQIA+ community with healthcare professionals, lawyers, and companies that respect diversity by offering job opportunities and professional development.</br>

                                <br>For social media, they opted for a visual representation leaning towards the visual style of street interventions, the periphery, urban chaos, where the representation of real bodies.</br>
                                
                                <br> My work involves generating ideas and scheduling with the entire team, creating social media posts based on the copy provided by the writing team, and publishing them.</br> </p>

                                <b>Concept</b> The idea was to bring the theme of inclusion to the public and how these bodies also show themselves within the LGBT+ community.</br>
                                
                                <br>Frame 1: Down syndrome people in the LGBT+ community</br>
                                
                                <br> Frame 2: Drag Syndrome - We are a company, and we deserve to perform: We deserve people with other talents with disabilities to join us. The art world, the culture world, and the world should include more people with Down syndrome or any disability. We must maintain a different way of seeing things. So the more we welcome them, the more rich society will be.</br>

                                <b>Concept</b> In this post, the idea was to look at the body and how it presents itself. Excerpts from music and interviews by singers Jup do Bairro and Linn da Quebrada, both transgender artists, were used.</br>

                                <br>Frame 2: Jup do Bairro - "What can a body without judgment do?
                                When to know that an abject body becomes an object body and vice versa?"</br>

                                <br>Frame 3: Linn da Quebrada - "We live in a world with consolidated cis-hetero and sexist systems and structures. These values build our identity, character, and what we understand as family. And each one of us produces and reproduces these models [...] At the same time, I point the gun at my head, and I need the courage to kill the white male in me, the plantation owner, the foreman, who thinks he's always ahead but lives behind ."</br>
